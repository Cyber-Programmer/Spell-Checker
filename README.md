# Spell-Checker
My recent project, Spell Corrector, is a comprehensive tool designed to efficiently manage and manipulate a dictionary of words. Leveraging a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure, the program allows for reading from and adding to the dictionary, while ensuring that duplicate entries are not included. By calculating the weighted value of each word based on the sum of the ASCII values of its characters, the BST facilitates rapid and organized storage. Additionally, the project enables users to search for specific words within the dictionary, providing confirmation of existence or suggesting similar words if a match is not found. Built entirely in C++, the project encompasses front-end development using the FireMonkey framework, as well as meticulous back-end coding that optimizes data retrieval through the effective utilization of data structures.
You can download C++ Builder to see or tweak it around. If you want to just run it then you can use the .exe file to run it. But you need to add the path of the dictionary file in the code first and compile it. Then you can run it.
