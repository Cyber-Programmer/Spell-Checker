# Spell-Checker

The Spell Corrector project is a comprehensive tool designed to efficiently manage and manipulate a dictionary of words. It leverages a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure for reading from and adding to the dictionary while preventing duplicate entries. The BST calculates the weighted value of each word based on the sum of the ASCII values of its characters, facilitating rapid and organized storage. Additionally, the project enables users to search for specific words within the dictionary, providing confirmation of existence or suggesting similar words if a match is not found. It is built entirely in C++ and encompasses front-end development using the FireMonkey framework, as well as meticulous back-end coding that optimizes data retrieval through the effective utilization of data structures.

Implementation Details:
- The project is built entirely in C++ and utilizes the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure.
- Calculation of the weighted value of each word based on the sum of the ASCII values of its characters enables rapid and organized storage.
- The project includes functionalities for reading from, adding to, and searching within the dictionary, providing a comprehensive tool for managing word lists.
- Front-end development is achieved using the FireMonkey framework, while meticulous back-end coding optimizes data retrieval through the effective utilization of data structures.

Running the Project:
To run the project, users can download C++ Builder to see or tweak it. Alternatively, they can use the .exe file by adding the path of the dictionary file in the code first and then compiling it before running.
